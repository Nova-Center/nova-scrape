## üß© How to Create a Plugin for **NovaScrape**

NovaScrape uses PF4J to load plugins dynamically. If you're looking to create your own plugin, you can use the **`example-plugin`** as a starting point.

## üöÄ Steps to Create a Plugin (Using `example-plugin` as a Template)

1. **Clone the `example-plugin`** module:
   The `example-plugin` is a fully functional sample plugin. You can use it as a base for your own plugins. Simply copy the module and rename it according to your needs.

2. **Modify the code**:

   * Change the plugin‚Äôs main class (`ExamplePlugin.java`) and the interface it implements (`NovaScrapePlugin`).
   * Update the extension methods, plugin ID, version, etc., to suit your plugin‚Äôs functionality.

3. **Create your own `plugin.properties` file**:
   The `plugin.properties` defines the plugin ID, version, and main class. You can customize this file for your own plugin.

4. **Build and deploy**:

   * Build your plugin as a `.jar` using Maven or IntelliJ.
   * Deploy it to the `plugins/` folder in your NovaScrape project.

5. **Run NovaScrape**:
   When you start NovaScrape, it will automatically load your plugin along with any other plugins present in the `plugins/` folder.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example Plugin: `example-plugin`

* Define a plugin and its extensions
* Set up the `plugin.properties` file

Once you‚Äôve made your modifications, your plugin will be ready to integrate with the NovaScrape host application.
